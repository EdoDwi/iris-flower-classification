Iris Flower Classification
This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. The model is trained using the Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning.

Project Structure
iris_classification.py: The main script to train and evaluate the machine learning model.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the project.
README.md: Project documentation (this file).
Dependencies
Python 3.7+
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
You can install the dependencies using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the script to train the model and evaluate its performance:

python iris_classification.py
The script will output the accuracy of the model and display a classification report.

Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, with 50 samples for each of the three species. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Model
The model used in this project is a simple Decision Tree classifier. Other classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) can also be used.

Results
The accuracy and classification report of the model will be displayed after running the script.
